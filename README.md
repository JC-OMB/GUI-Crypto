#In the ShoppingMain.java script we add Items, which for this case,
Are the cars for which every user has to order (we will implement Blockchain in the following commits, for the upcoming deliveries)
When the user adds a route (car + their route) to their order, the 
amount is added to their ItemOrder and shoppingcart (see in Item.java and ShoppingCart.java, where their functionalities are explained in detail)
